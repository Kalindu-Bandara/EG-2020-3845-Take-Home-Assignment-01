# Image Processing Assignment

This project contains Python programs to perform basic image processing tasks:

- Reduce the number of intensity levels in an image to a user-defined power-of-2 value.
- Apply average filtering with 3×3, 10×10, and 20×20 neighborhoods.
- Rotate an image by 45 and 90 degrees.
- Replace every non-overlapping block of size 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 pixels by their average color.

## How to Use

1. Place the input image as `input.jpg` in the same folder as the scripts.
2. Run the Python scripts.
3. Output images will be saved in the `results` folder.
